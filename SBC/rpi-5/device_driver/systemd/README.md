## Running Radioberry 

The radioberry-SDR image is setup using a service in combination with a daemon process.

The service is installed in /etc/systemd/systemd/radioberry.service

The daemon is place in /etc/init.d/radioberryd


Now you have control to the radioberry by using systemctl functions.

'''
sudo systemctl enable radioberry

sudo systemctl disable radioberry

sudo systemctl start radioberry

sudo systemctl stop radioberry

sudo systemctl restart radioberry

sudo systemctl status radioberry
'''

Using:

sudo journalctl -u radioberry

gives you logging information.


Like to know the process id of the daemon:  sudo /bin/pidof radioberry 
gives you the process id.
